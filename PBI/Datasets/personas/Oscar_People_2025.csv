For his work on Lion, he won the American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases and the AACTA Award for Best Cinematography and received Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations.  Fraser shot Rogue One on the Arri Alexa 65 large format digital camera and Panavision lenses from the 1970s, making it the first feature film shot entirely with the Alexa 65. Fraser said of working with the Alexa 65, ""The images are sharper and have more resolution, and those things are an advantage, but for me it is about the depth of the image—there is a three-dimensionality to it. Often the beauty came from the texture; we found that the camera excelled when we were filming something with texture; it really enhanced the quality of the picture.""  Fraser returned to the Star Wars franchise with the 2019 television series The Mandalorian. In 2020, for his work on the series, Fraser won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (Half-Hour).  For his work on Dune he won his first Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 2022. Fraser said a feature of his work in that film was intentionally using simple compositions: ""We tried to simplify the frames as much as we could. By doing that, we've been able to give the viewers that absorption of story and experience"" and colour palette: ""We tried quite hard to make sure that it all sat within a certain tone.""  Fraser met costume designer Jodie Fried in Sydney in 2004, while they were working on a short film. After moving to the United States in 2008, they were married in a helicopter above Las Vegas. They live in Los Angeles with their three children.  Film critic Glenn Kenny has praised Fraser's work in The Batman and Dune, saying they were a ""sort of stunning magic trick."" ""There's both a gauziness and a heft to his imagery. His use of shadow and silhouette is masterful and does so much to convey a sense of foreboding and tension."" Fellow cinematographer and Academy Award winner Roger Deakins praised Fraser's work on The Batman as ""extraordinary"" and called Fraser's and the film's omission from being nominated in the category at the 95th Academy Awards due to the Academy's tendency to avoid superhero films ""snobbery.""

Camille was born and raised in Paris. Her mother was an English-language teacher and her father, Hervé Dalmais, was a musician. As a teenager, she studied ballet and developed an interest in bossa nova music and American stage musicals. She attended the prestigious Lycée International de Saint Germain-en-Laye, where she obtained her baccalaureate in literature. Thanks to her mother being an English teacher, Camille speaks English fluently as well as her native French. She performed her first original song ""Un Homme Déserté"" at the age of sixteen while attending a wedding. In the early 2000s, while performing at jazz clubs in Paris, Camille made her acting debut in the film Les Morsures de l'aube (by Antoine de Caunes; with Asia Argento and Guillaume Canet). She also contributed to the song ""La Vie la Nuit"" in its soundtrack.  She attended Sciences Po Paris just before beginning her music career.  In early 2002, Camille signed a recording contract with Virgin Records. She released her first studio album Le Sac des Filles. In 2004, she began working with Marc Collin and his band Nouvelle Vague, which incorporates new wave and bossa nova music. She contributed vocals to the songs ""Too Drunk to Fuck"", ""In a Manner of Speaking"", ""The Guns of Brixton"", and ""Making Plans for Nigel"" on their first album.  In 2005, she released the album Le Fil, which was produced in collaboration with English producer MaJiKer. This album incorporated an avant-garde concept – a string, or thread (""le fil""), which was a drone that persisted throughout the entire course of the album. All of the songs on this album are based on the exploration of the voice, with only a double bass, bass guitar, guitar, trombone, percussion, or keyboard as accompanying instruments. Le Fil quickly became certified gold. The song ""Ta Douleur"" was voted 26th in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100, 2006.  In June 2007, Camille performed Benjamin Britten's A Ceremony of Carols and a new a cappella work God is sound (The 12 World Prayers) at L'église Saint-Eustache, Paris.  Camille's song ""1, 2, 3"" from Le Sac des Filles was used in the television ad for Cacharel's Promesse perfume starring Laetitia Casta and Matthew Avedon. Her song ""Waves"" was used in Perrier's ""Melting"" television ad.  Also in 2007, she contributed to the soundtrack of Pixar's Ratatouille, with the song entitled ""Le Festin"". Additionally, she provides the European French dub voice of Colette in Ratatouille.  Camille's album Music Hole was released on 7 April 2008, again produced in collaboration with MaJiKer. Music Hole was recorded and mixed by Valgeir Sigurdsson. The first single from the album, ""Gospel with No Lord"", was released for online download on 11 February 2008, along with another new song from the album entitled ""Money Note"".  Her song, ""Ta douleur"" was featured on the American television program Saturday Night Live. The original sketch aired in October 2010 titled ""Les jeunes de Paris"" hosted by actress Emma Stone. ...

Grimonprez wrote and directed the documentary Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat about the promise of decolonisation, the hope of the non-aligned movement and the dream of self-determination.  Grimonprez was born in 1962 in Roeselare, Belgium. After studying cultural anthropology, he went on to complete his studies in photography and mixed media at Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent. Grimonprez received an MFA in Video & Mixed Media at the School of Visual Arts in New York.

In 1993, Grimonprez worked on the series Besmette Stad for the program Ziggurat on Belgian television.  His films are characterised by a criticism of contemporary media manipulation, described as: ""an attempt to make sense of the wreckage wrought by history."" This films ""speak to the need to see history at a distance, but at the same time to speak from inside it"". Other themes include the relationship between the individual and the mainstream image, the notion of zapping as ""an extreme form of poetry"", and the questioning of our consensus reality, which Grimonprez defines as: ""a reality that is entangled with the stories we tell ourselves in the worldview we agree on sharing."" Grimonprez claims that ""Hollywood seems to be running ahead of reality. The world is so awash in images that we related to 9/11 through images we had already projected out into the world. In a sense, fiction came back to haunt us as reality. A perpetual distraction, this illusion of abundance staged by techno-magic hid the ugly face of an info-dystopia. Images of Abu Ghraib, 9/11, swine flu, the BP Gulf oil spill and the economic crisis composed our new contemporary sublime.""
